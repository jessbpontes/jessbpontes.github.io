                         <div class="blog-post-des">
                              <p>Embarking on the journey from a junior designer to a senior product designer is akin to ascending a hill, each step offering a new perspective and a broader view of the landscape. It’s a journey filled with challenges, lessons, and personal growth. Reflecting on my own trajectory from a junior UX designer at Liftbank to a senior product designer at CashAnalytics, I strongly believe that the evolution isn’t just about climbing the career ladder; it is about adopting the right mindset and embracing continuous improvement.</p>
                              <p>As a junior designer fresh out of Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo, my focus was narrow, even with great mentorship I was honing in on intricate design details without considering the bigger picture. I fixated on crafting visually appealing elements without fully grasping their broader implications within the product ecosystem. However, with experience came a shift in perspective. I learned to step back and view design holistically, considering its integration within the larger system and ensuring consistency across diverse applications.</p>
                              <p>Another crucial lesson learned along the way was the importance of slowing down. Initially, I approached tasks with a sense of urgency, aiming to accomplish everything swiftly. However, I soon realized the value of deliberate contemplation and thorough research in problem-solving. By taking the time to understand the nuances of each challenge, I not only produced better solutions but also streamlined the overall project workflow.</p>
                              <p>Moreover, transitioning from a solo player to a team player with a change of position and environment marked a significant milestone in my journey. Recognizing that design is a collaborative endeavor, I shifted my focus towards enhancing team dynamics and fostering a culture of innovation. At Autoglass, I started truly implementing strategies with autonomy, like design sprints and pair design processes that facilitated smoother collaboration and yielded superior outcomes.</p>
                                                          <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><img src="images/image -jess flow 5.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="resposabilities list">
                                                            <br>
                              <p>Cross-functional collaboration emerged as another area of emphasis as I progressed in my career. Senior designers don't merely hand off designs to engineers and wash their hands of the process; they actively engage in partnership, aligning goals and advocating for user-centric design principles across departments.</p>
                              <p>Yet, navigating the complexities of corporate landscapes demanded more than just design prowess. Understanding the company's business objectives and aligning design efforts with strategic goals became imperative. By incorporating business metrics and success indicators into my design process, I ensured that my work not only met user needs but also contributed to organizational growth.</p>
                              <p>Leadership skills also came to the forefront as I embraced the role of Senior designer. From persuasive communication to effective project planning, I cultivated a diverse set of soft skills necessary for guiding teams and driving impactful change within the organization.</p>
                              <p>However, perhaps the most transformative aspect of my journey was the shift in mindset towards failure. As a junior designer, I harbored fears of rejection and hesitated to step outside my comfort zone. Yet, with experience came resilience, and I learned to embrace failure as an essential part of the learning process. By reframing setbacks as opportunities for growth, I gained the confidence to tackle challenges head-on and pursue innovation fearlessly.</p>
                              <p>In essence, the transition from junior to senior designer isn't merely about acquiring technical skills or earning a prestigious title—it's about embodying a mindset of continual growth and adaptation. By embracing the lessons learned along the way and remaining open to new perspectives, aspiring designers can chart their own path towards success in the ever-evolving field of product design.</p>
