               <br> <p><strong> Client Overview:</strong>
                    Impact Medi is a dynamic start-up committed to addressing critical social issues by mobilizing the collective power of local communities. With a focus on fostering awareness and action, particularly amidst the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I sought to develop an interactive online platform. The primary objective was to create a visually stimulating and user-friendly webpage, tailored to resonate with children, while also addressing the needs of their customers and ensuring adaptability for future updates.

                    Meeting Customer Expectations: Anticipating and addressing the diverse needs of both children and adult users, while maintaining simplicity in navigation, presented a significant challenge.
                    Integrating COVID-19 Awareness: Seamlessly incorporating messaging around COVID-19 awareness and care within the colorful and interactive design was essential to my mission.
