                              <p><strong>How often have you found yourself tempted to make a design decision based on your personal preferences?</strong> It's a common scenario, especially when faced with challenges that hinder your workflow.</p>
                              <p>That's why I'm sharing my experience with <em>usability testing</em> during this quarantine period. Between tech limitations and remote communication hurdles, I found myself questioning if I could skip some steps.</p>
                              <p><strong>Spoiler alert: You should not.</strong></p>
                              <p>In my years as a UX designer, remote testing wasn't something I did often, despite the tools available. It just felt a bit foreign to me. But necessity called for it. If you're in a similar boat, here are some insights.</p>
                              <p><strong>"Don Norman once said, '<em>Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.'</em>"</p>
                              </strong> <p>Remote usability testing involves assessing how easy it is to use your product and understanding why users do what they do, all via remote channels. Participants interact with your product from their homes, using screen and voice recording software.</p>
                              <p>Normally, remote research is great because participants can use their own devices, letting you see how they set up their desktops and navigate between programs. But in my case, testing at the company would have been better. That's just one of the challenges I faced.</p>
                              <h3>1. Plan, Plan, Plan:</h3>
                              <p>Before you hit 'go,' double-check your plan. Planning is key.</p>
                              <ul style="margin-left: 10px;"></ul>
                                  <li>Set your research goals: What do you want to learn from testing this design with users?</li>
                                  <li>Think about what could go wrong: Unstable internet? Low-battery devices? Test everything beforehand.</li>
                                  <li>Sort out logistics: Who are you testing with, when, and how?<br> I did moderated testing, giving participants tasks and survey questions. After setting up meetings, we had to make sure the recording software worked for everyone. Some computers couldn't handle it, but we found a workaround. It was frustrating when the recording quality wasn't great at first.</li>
                              </ul>
                              <h3>2. Be clear and concise with your writing and speaking:
                              </h3>
                              <p>When applying a moderated test is important to stick to the script in the way that you say the exact same information to the participants. The questions that will guide your participants during the test can go wildly of the line if you don’t pay attention, and you can end with leading questions to compensate.</p>
                              <p><strong>Do:</strong></p>
                              <ul style="margin-left: 10px;"></ul>
                                  <li>Let participants know what to expect. Talk then through the process and give reassuarence of confidentiality and other aspects.</li>
                                  <li>Create a relaxed atmosphere so they feel comfortable sharing. You can you a joke as "ice-breaker" or start chatting about their day.</li>
                                  <li>Book enough time. Sometimes you will not use a full hour but is better to have a organized schedule and use the extra time to take notes.</li>
                             
                              </ul>
                              
                              <br><p><strong>Don't:</strong></p>
                              <ul style="margin-left: 10px;">
                                  <li>Forget to prep. Not reviewing your script might cause issues during the interview and generate inaccurate answers.</li>
                                  <li>Get too many people involved, which can overwhelm participants and yourself.</li>
                                  <li>Rush. Don't panic is the time is ending. Prioritize the main question in your script.</li>
                              </ul>

                              <h3>3. Keep It Short:</h3>
                              <p>Respect participants' time.<br>Be mindful of your users’ time and keep your tests short. If you do have many tasks and scenarios that you want to test, divide them by categories and split them up into different usability sessions. It can also help to avoid internet connection problems.</p>
                              <br>
                              <p><strong>Thanks for reading this far!</strong></p>
