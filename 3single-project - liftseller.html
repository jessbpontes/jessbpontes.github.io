                         <h3> <strong>The context</strong></h3>
                             The Liftpay team worked as a side business of the Liftbank company. 
                              Building the products in collaboration with many partners our team was responsible 
                              for all that concerned payment solutions.
                              Lift Seller is one of the products linked to the Liftpay payment solution, which aims 
                              to make entrepreneurs’ lives easier by using technology for a fluid experience. This product 
                              was designed for the exclusive use of Liftpay registered sellers in order to improve the number of selling and
                               for registering customers quickly and securely. This application transformed the tradicional buying and registration 
                               process of a new client in a 3 to 5 minutes journey inside the app.
                         <div>
                     <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
                         <p><h3> <strong>The challenge</strong></h3>
                              In this scenario there were 3 problems:
                              <br>
                              <strong> Decrease of sales:</strong>Digital campaigns were not as effective in the target audience as expected. It was noticed by user interviews that our custumer was much more susceptible to the face-to-face sales model. This discovery led to the hiring of sellers to our payment solution team, but their performance had some requirements.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <strong> Negotiate rates:</strong> One of the strengths of Liftpay was the low negotiable rates depending on the type of the custumer business. Manage this personable feesa and deals for all clients was getting manualy was getting out of control for the Sales manager.
                              <br>
                              <br> <strong>Register customers quickly and safely:</strong> An efficient registration flow, promotes a good experience when it is fast and clear. However, in the payment solutions scenario, a minimum amount of information is necessary and expected to guarantee the safety of the client and the company.

                              <p><h3> <strong> Research and interviews</strong></h3>
                                   To understand the daily life of the sellers hired and customers preferences who would have contact with this product, I conducted a research and interviews with the company’s sales department and some customers already registered
                                   <br>I like to learn from existing products, avoid reinventing the wheel in my processes and always try to improve what is available, and then think of an innovative solution.                                   
                                 <br>
                                  <br> <strong> Researched the salespeople and their work routine.
                              </strong> <br> <strong>Collected data already available on registration and sales.
                              </strong>   <br> <br>     Some relevant points found:

                                   Feedback from our Capixabas(locals) clients has given me some insights into the flow and improvements of the current register. Some important points were considered, such as:

                                        Below we have the partial flow of the application, showing the user's three main steel flows so that it only asks for the indispensable information.
