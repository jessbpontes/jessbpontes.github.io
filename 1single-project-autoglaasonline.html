     <p><h3> <strong> Context </strong></h3>
          Autoglass is a leading company in the automobile sector with the largest glass stock in Latin America and the widest variety of automotive parts throughout Brazil. With a network of more than 60 stores nationwide, Autoglass has built its reputation on quality, safety, and service excellence—standards that needed to be reflected in their digital presence.
     </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
     <p><h3> <strong> Challenge </strong></h3>
          The existing Autoglass e-commerce platform was failing to deliver an online experience that matched the company's offline reputation. Working closely with the team at Autoglass Online, we developed the content necessary to build the custom eCommerce website in the most simplistic, yet high-quality manner possible.
          <br><br>
          During the process, there were many obstacles including product images, legacy codes, and the hurdle of building an efficient eCommerce website with more than 20,000 products. However, the site was launched in a timely manner, and the results exceeded expectations. In the first two weeks after the product page going up, organic traffic increased over 1000% and the help chat was less active than the prior 6 months!

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
     <p><h3> <strong> Research & Discovery </strong></h3>
          Our process began with a comprehensive analysis of the existing user experience. We conducted a heuristic analysis to systematically evaluate the site against established usability principles and identify key pain points. User interviews revealed frustrations with the search functionality and checkout process, while data analysis highlighted abandonment patterns and user behavior anomalies.
     </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
     <p><h3> <strong> Strategy </strong></h3>
          After reviewing the original site and conducting customer interviews, we knew that we didn't need to completely rebuild the website from the ground up. We began by developing a plan of priorities and mapping the main problems with a heuristic analysis.
          <br><br>
          Based on our findings, we focused on:
          <br>
          - Prioritizing improvements for greatest impact<br>
          - Restructuring information architecture<br>
          - Applying visual standardization<br>
          - Optimizing user flows<br>
          - Improving content clarity
          <br><br>
          We developed new wireframes and flat designs that were later built into a website. We also worked with internal clients to gather customer feedback, create new product images and descriptions, and built a functional e-commerce website able to handle purchasing, financing, and shipping anywhere in Brazil.

          - Standardized colors and imagery according to the company's design system<br>
          - Created clearer visual hierarchy to guide users through the experience
          <br><br>
          <strong>Functional Improvements:</strong><br>
          - Redesigned search functionality to be more intuitive and accurate<br>
          - Simplified the navigation system for better category discovery<br>
          - Optimized the product detail pages to highlight critical information<br>
          - Streamlined the checkout process to reduce abandonment
     </p>
</div>

<div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
     <p><h3> <strong> Main Visual Changes </strong></h3>
          We reduced visual overload, standardized colors and images according to the company Design System, changed the architecture of some pages, the layout and operation of the menus. We also changed the labels and some texts for expressions that users better understand. You can also check at: www.autoglassonline.com.br
