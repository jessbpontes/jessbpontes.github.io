                         <h3> <strong>The context</strong></h3>
                         <p>This case study offers a brief journey into the development of a <strong>digital solution dedicated to enhancing the healthcare journey for cancer patients. </strong> It elucidates the methodology utilized, which blends Service Design (SD) and User-Centered Design (UCD) principles, ultimately crafting a solution finely attuned to the genuine needs of users.</p>
                         <p>I was the only Designer within the company, so embarking on a journey that commenced with the project in its research and discovery phase was extremely important as it allowed me to immerse myself in a topic previously unfamiliar to me, collect and analyze data from interviews, and get familiar with the respective users/stakeholders. Subsequently, this project evolved to become the theme of my master's thesis.<p><strong>Not all phases of the Process will be described here because of the extent of it but did my best to cover the most important aspects.</p></strong>
                          <div>

                              <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                                   <h3> <strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

                                   <p> As it is a not-so-common topic, it is important to explain a bit of the area of this project. In the landscape of healthcare software development, our focus has been on creating a tailored solution to meet the intricate needs of physicians and patients. The project started with the recognition of a critical gap in the provision of digital tools for medical professionals. To reduce the scope of the initial MPV, we directed our efforts toward addressing the specific challenges faced by physicians and doctors specializing in prostate cancer. </p>
                                   <p>Prostate cancer holds significant importance within the realm of oncology and healthcare for several reasons. Firstly, it ranks as the second most common cancer among men globally and the fourth most common cancer overall. (WCRF International, 2020). By focusing our software service on this demographic, we are targeting a substantial and underserved segment of the medical community.</p>
                                   <p>The decision to prioritize prostate cancer in our software development endeavors was further reinforced by the invaluable support and expertise of a prominent physician, professor, and researcher specializing in this domain. As an investor and stakeholder in our project, his involvement not only lends credibility but also ensures that our software aligns closely with the clinical realities and best practices in prostate cancer care.</p>

                                   <p>Benchmarking:
                                        Our investigation revealed a full hand of software solutions catering to both private and public healthcare sectors, available in various forms such as systems, mobile apps, and websites. To analyze and compare these offerings effectively, we applied benchmarking principles commonly used in industry to evaluate performance and market position. Focusing on our project's objective of aiding oncology physicians in data management and patient connectivity throughout the cancer journey, we conducted targeted searches using keywords like EHR, HDM, and HIM. We also considered software mentioned in interviews and surveys, filtering out solutions not relevant to physician or patient use. Survey findings highlighted specific software like Tasy, Docway, and Uptodate, providing insight into market trends and identifying potential competitors. Further analysis of these solutions across key design variables revealed prominent features but lacked distinctive interface design or usability enhancements.

<strong><p><p>Key Takeaways </strong></p></p>
<ul> Market segmentation is clear with major competitors already identified.
EHR systems have potential but face legal, efficiency, and interoperability challenges.
Optimizing workflows can improve both patient and physician experiences.
A user-centered approach (personas, journeys) is critical for designing effective healthcare solutions.</ul>




                                             

                                   <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left ">
                                        <p><h3> <strong>Personas:</strong></h3> 
                                   
                                             <p>Three primary macro personas and one secondary persona were developed based on stakeholder interviews, user interviews, and survey data to represent high-level users of the product.</p>
                                             <p><strong>1.Medical Secretary (Lidia Miles): </strong>Lidia, a 33-year-old woman working in a private clinic as a medical secretary, serves as the primary point of contact. Her responsibilities include managing patient data, staying updated, and handling appointments. She has a medium understanding of technology but faces challenges with user-unfriendly systems.</p>
                                             <p><strong>2.General Practitioner (Doctor Daniel):</strong> Doctor Daniel, a 30-year-old man working in a private clinic, serves as a general practitioner. He manages a large number of consultation appointments and struggles with connectivity issues between systems, despite having good tech literacy.</p>
                                             <p><strong>3.Radiation Oncologist (Dr. Peidraigh):</strong> Dr. Peidraigh plays a crucial role in the treatment process for prostate cancer. He collaborates with other physicians to determine the best treatment for each patient. He faces challenges with using technology due to low tech literacy but requires tools for efficient communication and data storage.</p>
                                             <p><strong>Secondary Persona:</strong></p>
                                             <p><strong>Patient:</strong> This persona, representing a patient managing multiple medications for the first time after a new diagnosis, seeks reliable information sources and may need support to understand treatment processes and side effects. They may use a mobile phone for information but may not be interested in online data entry.</p>
                                             <p>These personas guide the design and development process by representing typical user behavior and requirements, ensuring a user-friendly system aligned with user needs. Additionally, user journey maps are integrated with the personas to enhance user experience throughout the product's lifecycle.</p>

    <h3><strong>User journeys and flows</strong></h3>
    
    <p>To close the scope of this case study a bit more let's focus on the journey of the physicians and their secretary in a specialized clinic.</p>
    
    <p>The patient journey starts with a referral acceptance by the physician, followed by document scanning and appointment scheduling. During consultations, handwritten notes are preferred. Patients may proceed with treatment or be referred to specialists, with all data needing re-uploading for sharing. Invoices are printed for patients, including insurance details. GPs play a vital role in cancer care, handling diagnostics, treatment discussions, and side effects management. Radiation Oncologists follow common consultation patterns, from symptom presentation to diagnosis and prescription. Organizations may overlook steps in the patient journey, impacting the overall experience.</p>

     <p><h3> <strong>Wrapping up the data collected</strong></h3>                                             
<p>The extensive research conducted provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex prostate cancer patient journey and the healthcare ecosystem surrounding it. Several key insights emerge from our analysis:</p>
    
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight-title">1. Patient Journey Complexity</div>
        <div class="insight-content">
            Figure 57 illustrates how prostate cancer consultations follow three main patterns (initial consultation, exam requests, and follow-up/prescription renewal), each involving multiple touchpoints that require significant patient effort for scheduling, commuting, and coordination.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight-title">2. Interconnected Stakeholder Network</div>
        <div class="insight-content">
            The experience connection map (Figure 58) reveals the rich ecosystem of relationships between patients, healthcare providers, locations, and contextual factors. This demonstrates that healthcare experiences extend far beyond the traditional doctor-patient relationship to include multiple care locations, family support, administrative staff, and influencing factors like finances, language, and cultural considerations.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight-title">3. Digital Solution Architecture</div>
        <div class="insight-content">
            Our information architecture maps for both the healthcare provider portal (Figure 59) and patient mobile application (Figure 60) address the core needs identified in the research. The HCP portal focuses on streamlining clinical workflows for e-prescribing, referrals, and patient case management, while the patient app prioritizes appointment booking, medication tracking, and health monitoring.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight-title">4. Pain Points and Opportunities</div>
        <div class="insight-content">
            Through interviews and literature review, we identified significant friction in the current healthcare communication systems. Patients typically begin their journey with concerning symptoms, conduct internet research, and then navigate a fragmented scheduling system involving multiple methods (phone calls, emails, software systems). Our proposed digital ecosystem creates a unified channel to connect these previously disconnected experiences.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="insight-container">
        <div class="insight-title">5. User-Centered Approach</div>
        <div class="insight-content">
            By developing separate but integrated interfaces for healthcare providers and patients, our solution addresses the specific needs of each user group while facilitating better communication between them. The straightforward information architecture prioritizes accessibility for users of all ages and technical abilities.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="conclusion">
        <p>This research has guided our focus toward a specific part of the patient journey—setting up and attending consultations—as the initial area for prototype development, with room for expansion as the product evolves. The proposed web portal and mobile application ecosystem aims to transform the fragmented healthcare communication landscape into a cohesive, user-friendly experience for both providers and patients.</p>
