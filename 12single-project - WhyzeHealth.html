                         <h3> <strong>The context</strong></h3>
                         <p>This case study offers a brief journey into the development of a <strong>digital solution dedicated to enhancing the healthcare journey for cancer patients. </strong> It elucidates the methodology utilized, which blends Service Design (SD) and User-Centered Design (UCD) principles, ultimately crafting a solution finely attuned to the genuine needs of users.</p>
                         <p>I was the only Designer within the company, so embarking on a journey that commenced with the project in its research and discovery phase was extremely important as it allowed me to immerse myself in a topic previously unfamiliar to me, collect and analyze data from interviews, and get familiar with the respective users/stakeholders. Subsequently, this project evolved to become the theme of my master's thesis.<p><strong>Not all phases of the Process will be described here because of the extent of it but did my best to cover the most important aspects.</p></strong>
                          <div>

                              <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 text-left">
                                   <h3> <strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

                                   <p> As it is a not-so-common topic, it is important to explain a bit of the area of this project. In the landscape of healthcare software development, our focus has been on creating a tailored solution to meet the intricate needs of physicians and patients. The project started with the recognition of a critical gap in the provision of digital tools for medical professionals. To reduce the scope of the initial MPV, we directed our efforts toward addressing the specific challenges faced by physicians and doctors specializing in prostate cancer. </p>
                                   <p>Prostate cancer holds significant importance within the realm of oncology and healthcare for several reasons. Firstly, it ranks as the second most common cancer among men globally and the fourth most common cancer overall. (WCRF International, 2020). By focusing our software service on this demographic, we are targeting a substantial and underserved segment of the medical community.</p>
                                   <p>The decision to prioritize prostate cancer in our software development endeavors was further reinforced by the invaluable support and expertise of a prominent physician, professor, and researcher specializing in this domain. As an investor and stakeholder in our project, his involvement not only lends credibility but also ensures that our software aligns closely with the clinical realities and best practices in prostate cancer care.</p>

                                   <p>Benchmarking:
                                        Our investigation revealed a full hand of software solutions catering to both private and public healthcare sectors, available in various forms such as systems, mobile apps, and websites. To analyze and compare these offerings effectively, we applied benchmarking principles commonly used in industry to evaluate performance and market position. Focusing on our project's objective of aiding oncology physicians in data management and patient connectivity throughout the cancer journey, we conducted targeted searches using keywords like EHR, HDM, and HIM. We also considered software mentioned in interviews and surveys, filtering out solutions not relevant to physician or patient use. Survey findings highlighted specific software like Tasy, Docway, and Uptodate, providing insight into market trends and identifying potential competitors. Further analysis of these solutions across key design variables revealed prominent features but lacked distinctive interface design or usability enhancements.

                                             <p>Three primary macro personas and one secondary persona were developed based on stakeholder interviews, user interviews, and survey data to represent high-level users of the product.</p>
                                             <p><strong>1.Medical Secretary (Lidia Miles): </strong>Lidia, a 33-year-old woman working in a private clinic as a medical secretary, serves as the primary point of contact. Her responsibilities include managing patient data, staying updated, and handling appointments. She has a medium understanding of technology but faces challenges with user-unfriendly systems.</p>
                                             <p><strong>2.General Practitioner (Doctor Daniel):</strong> Doctor Daniel, a 30-year-old man working in a private clinic, serves as a general practitioner. He manages a large number of consultation appointments and struggles with connectivity issues between systems, despite having good tech literacy.</p>
                                             <p><strong>3.Radiation Oncologist (Dr. Peidraigh):</strong> Dr. Peidraigh plays a crucial role in the treatment process for prostate cancer. He collaborates with other physicians to determine the best treatment for each patient. He faces challenges with using technology due to low tech literacy but requires tools for efficient communication and data storage.</p>
                                             <p><strong>Secondary Persona:</strong></p>
                                             <p><strong>Patient:</strong> This persona, representing a patient managing multiple medications for the first time after a new diagnosis, seeks reliable information sources and may need support to understand treatment processes and side effects. They may use a mobile phone for information but may not be interested in online data entry.</p>
                                             <p>These personas guide the design and development process by representing typical user behavior and requirements, ensuring a user-friendly system aligned with user needs. Additionally, user journey maps are integrated with the personas to enhance user experience throughout the product's lifecycle.</p>

                                      <p> To close the scope of this case study a bit more let's focus on the journey of the physicians and their secretary in a specialized clinic.
                                   </p> <p>The patient journey starts with a referral acceptance by the physician, followed by document scanning and appointment scheduling. During consultations, handwritten notes are preferred. Patients may proceed with treatment or be referred to specialists, with all data needing re-uploading for sharing. Invoices are printed for patients, including insurance details. GPs play a vital role in cancer care, handling diagnostics, treatment discussions, and side effects management. Radiation Oncologists follow common consultation patterns, from symptom presentation to diagnosis and prescription. Organizations may overlook steps in the patient journey, impacting the overall experience.
