Key pain point: Administrators must individually assign line items to each business unit, creating a time-consuming workflow
Archiving functionality is inadequate - archived items lose context of where they were previously used
Business units cannot be archived by users (only deleted by support)
Management interfaces are fragmented across multiple screens
Lack of bulk actions forces repetitive tasks
No visibility into archived items within reports unless specifically configured
Current design lacks logical consistency in how model components relate to each other
